## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Add JitPack as repository**

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)

## Usage

### Creating a Scoreboard

To create a scoreboard, you need to define a custom `ScoreboardData` class that extends
`net.tfj.scoreboardAPI.ScoreboardData`. This class should specify the lines and their behavior.

```kotlin
object ReadMeScoreboard : ScoreboardData(
    "readme",
    "ReadMe <aqua><bold>Scoreboard</bold></aqua>",
    NumberFormat.styled(Style.style(NamedTextColor.DARK_GRAY)),
    listOf(
        StaticLineEntry("Welcome to My Server"),
        DataLineEntry("Player count: ${Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers().size}/${Bukkit.getMaxPlayers()}"),
        EmptyLine(),
        AnimatedLineEntry(
            listOf(
                { "0oo" },
                { "o0o" },
                { "oo0" },
                { "o0o" },
            ),
            2,
            100
        ),
    )
)
```

### Customizing Line Entries

The library provides several types of line entries, including:

- **StaticLineEntry**: Displays a static text that doesn't change.
- **DataLineEntry**: Updates its content based on data, such as player count or time.
- **AnimatedLineEntry**: Animates the line entry over time.
- **EmptyLine**: Adds an empty line for spacing.

### Handling Player Joins

To ensure a fresh scoreboard for each player upon joining, reset or set a scoreboard on player on

```kotlin
fun join(event: PlayerJoinEvent) {
    scoreboardAPI.resetScoreboard(event.player)
    // or
    scoreboardAPI.setScoreboard(ExampleScoreboard)
}
```
